# T1ify

The aim of T1ify is to transform non T1 weighted MRI images to have a similar contrast profile to an adult T1 image. 
The main aim of this is to not only improve rgistrations results by increasing mutual information, but also allowing for datasets lacking T1 images to have cortical reconstruction in freesurfer like cortical surface pipelines. T1ify is a learning project as much as a goal oriented project to create a really useful tool. Feel free to join if you want to learn by doing and convert those other modalities to T1's!

# Required Skills
